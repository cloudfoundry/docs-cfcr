## v0.29.0
[Download](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/releases/download/v0.29.0/kubo-deployment-0.29.0.tgz) the release artifact.

**Release Date:** Feb 14, 2019

* **Important:** Replaced the `etcd` certificates and authorities with a unique CA (`etcd_ca`) to address [CVE-2019-3779](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-3779). **See the [Action Required](#action-required) section for details.**
* Bumped Docker to `v18.06.2-ce`.
* Upgraded `flannel` to `v0.11.0`.
* Upgraded `bpm` to `v1.0.3`.
* Removed `kube-dns` as an option from `apply-addons`.

### Action Required

Users upgrading from earlier versions of CFCR must perform a series of upgrade steps to facilitate a smooth rotation of the `etcd` certificates.

With BOSH, certificate rotations require a three-phase process that generates a CA, generates and utilizes a set of end-user certificates, and retires the original CA.

The three phases are as follows:

1. Generate the new `etcd_ca` and add it to the list of trust anchors for `etcd`.
2. Generate the new client and server certificates from `etcd_ca` and begin using them.
3. Remove the old CA (`kubo_ca`) from `etcd`'s trust anchors.

Perform the steps below.

#### Steps

1. Redeploy the existing CFCR deployment, applying an additional ops-file for phase one:
  ```yaml
  - type: replace
    path: /variables/-
    value:
      name: etcd_ca
      options:
        common_name: etcd.ca
        is_ca: true
      type: certificate

  - type: replace
    path: /instance_groups/name=master/jobs/name=etcd/properties/tls/etcd/ca
    value: ((tls-etcd-v0-17-0.ca))((etcd_ca.certificate))

  - type: replace
    path: /instance_groups/name=master/jobs/name=etcd/properties/tls/etcdctl/ca
    value: ((tls-etcdctl.ca))((etcd_ca.certificate))

  - type: replace
    path: /instance_groups/name=master/jobs/name=etcd/properties/tls/peer/ca
    value: ((tls-etcd-v0-17-0.ca))((etcd_ca.certificate))
  ```

2. Redeploy the existing CFCR deployment, removing the ops-file for phase one and applying the ops-file for phase two:
  ```yaml
  - type: replace
    path: /variables/-
    value:
      name: etcd_ca
      options:
        common_name: etcd.ca
        is_ca: true
      type: certificate

  - type: replace
    path: /variables/-
    value:
      name: tls-etcd-v0-29-0
      options:
        ca: etcd_ca
        common_name: '*.etcd.cfcr.internal'
        extended_key_usage:
          - client_auth
          - server_auth
      type: certificate

  - type: replace
    path: /variables/-
    value:
      name: tls-etcdctl-v0-29-0
      options:
        ca: etcd_ca
        common_name: 'etcdClient'
        extended_key_usage:
          - client_auth
      type: certificate

  - type: replace
    path: /instance_groups/name=master/jobs/name=etcd/properties/tls/etcd
    value:
      ca: ((tls-etcd-v0-17-0.ca))((etcd_ca.certificate))
      certificate: ((tls-etcd-v0-29-0.certificate))
      private_key: ((tls-etcd-v0-29-0.private_key))

  - type: replace
    path: /instance_groups/name=master/jobs/name=etcd/properties/tls/etcdctl
    value:
      ca: ((tls-etcdctl.ca))((etcd_ca.certificate))
      certificate: ((tls-etcdctl-v0-29-0.certificate))
      private_key: ((tls-etcdctl-v0-29-0.private_key))

  - type: replace
    path: /instance_groups/name=master/jobs/name=etcd/properties/tls/peer
    value:
      ca: ((tls-etcd-v0-17-0.ca))((etcd_ca.certificate))
      certificate: ((tls-etcd-v0-29-0.certificate))
      private_key: ((tls-etcd-v0-29-0.private_key))
  ```

3. Upgrade to `v0.29.0`, completing phase three.

## v0.24.0
[Download](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/releases/download/v0.24.0/kubo-deployment-0.24.0.tgz) the release artifact.

**Release Date:** Nov 9, 2018

**BREAKING CHANGE** In order to expose all of the kubernetes configuration the manifest format has changed. All the properties for Kubernetes jobs, for example _[kube-apiserver](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/160558973), [kubelet](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/160885959), [kube-proxy](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/160896710), [cloud-provider](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161421611) etc_. have been placed under `k8s-args` section. Now, every flag that Kubernetes job has can be passed to the Bosh release. All properties in `kubo-deployment` have been changed. If you have custom operation files to modify the manifest, you will need to change them before you upgrade.

In addition to kubernetes job properties being exposed, [cloud provider](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161421611) flags are now exposed to allows more flexible configuration. Any configuration in the source cloud provider will be exposed in the release, for all IaaS.

For more information on modifying kubernetes arguments refer to [this page](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/blob/master/docs/configuring-kubernetes-properties.md) in our docs.

**NOTICE** While all the properties have been exposed in the release, CFCR team does not support properties that are not part of the `kubo-deployment` manifest or ops-files.

### Kube-apiserver Admission Controllers
In exposing the kubernetes configuration, we now expose the **admission-controllers**. We support the kubernetes defaults, and adding the following additional admission controllers: DenyEscalatingExec, SecurityContextDeny and [PodSecurity Policy](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/155793102).

*  **SECURITY** The DenyEscalatingExec and SecurityContextDeny admission control plugins are no longer enabled by default. This change was made to better align CFCR with the Kubernetes admission controller defaults and to make it easier to for ops-files to incrementally enable or disable the additional plugins. We recommend that you harden your cluster by applying these ops-files to your manifest.:
  - `kubo-deployment/manifests/ops-files/enable-denyescalatingexec.yml`
  - `kubo-deployment/manifests/ops-files/enable-securitycontextdeny.yml `

* **SECURITY** we have modified our system add-ons PodSecurityPolicy controller works with system addons out-of-the-box. To enable the controller and use policies apply the following ops-file `kubo-deployment/manifests/ops-files/enable-podsecuritypolicy.yml`. CFCR **does not** create default Policy for applications. Please, follow the documentation to enable them https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/. You need to create PodSecurityPolicy in advance if you upgrading the cluster in order to prevent application downtime. This can be done manually or using new `post-start-custom-specs` property on `kubernetes-roles` job.

### Other changes
* It is now possible to **backup and restore** the cluster control plane when there is 3 masters. This was done by updating the BBR scripts in our etcd release. Thank you Platform Recovery Team for their [PR](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/160512406)

* **Azure** deployment now in Beta stage, with a number of changes in v0.24. Use stemcell from xenial 170 line to deploy it. We expect a number of changes to come in future releases to complete our support coverage.

* We have [exposed the live-restore flag](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161166008) in the docker release, and setting this to true in our manifest. This is to improve workload stability in failure scenarios where the docker daemon is restarted.

* In order for us to support NFS Storage Class in Kubernetes, we now install the the nfs-common library. This was removed in the Xenial stemcell line. – [bug](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161318475)

* We have extended our multi-cloud support to **Azure**.  [PR #223](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/pull/223)
  _We consider this experimental as we learn, iterate and extended our test infrastructure._

* As previously announced, the route-sync functionality is now removed. [#158559777](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/158559777)

* In order to help automate the maintenance load balancers for master nodes during deploy and upgrade on GCP, we have added the _backend-service_ in our default vm_extensions - [#160417211](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/160417211)

## v0.22.0
[Download](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/releases/download/v0.22.0/kubo-deployment-0.22.0.tgz) the release artifact.

**Release Date:** Sept 28, 2018

* Upgraded to Kubernetes v1.11.3

* In order to allow workloads that have a security context configuration, the SecurityContextDeny admission controller can now be disabled through a ops-file, it will continued to be enabled by default. The allow-privilege property and corresponding ops-file will no longer disable the SecurityContextDeny admission controller.
  _This is a change in behaviour, if you were using allow-privileged to disable SecurityContextDeny, you should now use the disable-security-context-deny.yml ops-file_

* The kubo-release version set in manifest is configured to the most recent released version. It will no longer be _latest_ or bundled within the _kubo-deployment_ release artifact. The _kubo-deployment_ folder name specifies the version.

* For GCP deployment we have allowed for the setting of the sub-network name. Doing this will allow for services using internal loadbalancers to be deployed – [GH issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/issues/183)

* CFCR no longer supplies scripts to deploy BOSH. We assume a BOSH director has been provisioned, with some standard cloud config dependencies. If you need to deploy BOSH we recommend using [BOSH Boot Loader](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader). See the guide below for migration away from _deploy_bosh_.

* Added an [ops-file](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/blob/master/manifests/cloud-config/iaas/vsphere/use-vm-extensions.yml) to use vm_extensions to on vSphere, namely disk.enableUUID

* **Documentation** We have provided instructions on how to configure Kubernetes with a Cloud Provider for each Iaas in our [docs](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/blob/master/docs/cloud-provider.md). The cloud provider interfaces with the IAAS to provision TCP Load Balancers, Nodes, Networking Routes, and Persistent Volumes.

### deploy_bosh Migration Guide

Going forward, we're encouraging users to discontinue using the deprecated deploy_bosh and deploy_k8s scripts. To help with the transition from the scripts to
standard practices for managing bosh deployments, we've outlined a few changes to be aware of:

**Cloud Config**

Previously the _deploy_bosh_ scripts would generate a compatible cloud config for CFCR clusters. The generated cloud-configs are still valid and can be used. See our [documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release#prerequisites) for cloud-config for requirements.
If you are configuring CFCR with a cloud provider, we've moved to using vm_extensions defined with BOSH generic configs. See our cloud-provider [documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/blob/master/docs/cloud-provider.md) to see how to set this up.

**Deployment Manifest**

Instead of generating a manifest via the _deploy_k8s_ script, we encourage users to follow our deployment docs and create a bosh deploy command with ops-files appropriate for their CFCR clusters.
One of the big reasons we deprecated these scripts was to decouple the bosh director provisioning steps when creating CFCR clusters. Previously, _deploy_bosh_ would create an artifact called _director.yml_ and this file was used in _deploy_k8s_ to provision CFCR clusters. The _director.yml_ file contains credentials that can still be used as vars to bosh deploy command. However the file itself is not required.

## v0.21.0
[Download](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/releases/download/v0.21.0/kubo-deployment-0.21.0.tgz) the release artifact.

**Release Date:** August 29, 2018

!!! note
	The Kubernetes 1.11 release kicked off the deprecation timeline for the Heapster component, see https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/blob/master/docs/deprecation.md for more info. As a result, we're in the process of replacing Heapster with Metrics Server in an upcoming releases of kubo-release. Once that process is complete, Heapster will no longer be a default addon applied in 'apply-specs' errand.

* We are deploying metrics server by default as part of the _apply-specs_ errand. Heapster is still deployed but will be removed in a future release – [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/157915809)

* With metrics server deployed securely, CFCR supports [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/). This includes optional HPA configuration flags as part of CFCR release spec. – [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/157915809)

* **Fix:** We found and responded to an issue in kubernetes, which was causing issues with updating StatefulSet workloads on AWS. We have improved our drain behvaviour, and there is a manual workaround – [bug](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/159732987)
_If you find the rare case, where a pod that uses volumes is stuck in ContainerCreating state after upgrade, also you can see FailedMount message when you run kubectl describe pod <pod name> command. To manually fix it, recreate a worker using bosh recreate worker/<id>_

* We have included CoreDNS as an optional addon. This can be set by applying the _use-coredns.yml_ ops-file before running the apply-specs errand – [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/159696570)
_CoreDNS should be deployed in place of kube-dns. kube-dns deployment should be deleted from existing clusters, after deploying CoreDNS_

* **Fix:** There is an issue deploying v0.20 in environments not connected an internet registry. We fixed the name in a packaged docker image – [bug](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/159706265)

* We have enabled the HostPort feature, to allow pods to open external ports on the worker node. This includes an upgrade to the CNI component to v0.7.1 – [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/159167067)

* We have incorporated Kubernetes release v1.11.2

## v0.20.0
[Download](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/releases/download/v0.20.0/kubo-deployment-0.20.0.tgz) the release artifact.

**Release Date:** August 8, 2018

**Known Issue** There is an [issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/issues/243) with deploying cfcr v0.20 in airgapped environments, related to an image dependency. This will be fixed in the next release.

### Features

* Upgraded Kubernetes version to v1.11. For more information about the upgrade, see story [#159328985](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/159328985) in the CFCR Tracker. For more information about Kubernetes v1.11, see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.11.md#kubernetes-111-release-notes).
* Upgraded the default stemcell to Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial. For more information about the upgrade, see story [#158004796](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/158004796) in the CFCR Tracker.

    !!! tip
        If you used CFCR’s `./deploy_bosh` script to deploy your BOSH director, we recommend updating the BOSH runtime config, as it has a reference to Ubuntu Trusty. For more information, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/runtime-config/).

* This release includes BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) scripts to restore the state of a cluster from a backup. For more information about the feature, see stories [#158945642](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/158945642) and [#158946553](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/158946553) in the CFCR Tracker. For more information about BBR, see the [BBR documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/).

    !!! note
        The BBR functionality is verified against a single-master cluster running stateless workloads. We will support further verified scenarios in future versions.

* Upgraded the ETCD release to v3.3.9.

* **Deprecation notice**: Heapster is officially deprecated in Kubernetes v1.11. We will remove it by default in favor of `metrics-server` in a future release.

**Release Date:** March 20, 2018

* Removed edge case where timeouts during upgrades could lead to Etcd data loss -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/155814661).
* Added the ability to configure the HTTP(s) proxy to be used by the Kubernetes control plane -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/154717574).
* Made Kube-DNS use its own configuration so that the Kubelet configuration is not exposed in the Kube-DNS container -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/154873779).
- **Fix:** Allowed `\` and `|` to be used in vCenter passwords -- [cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release#180](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/issues/180).
* **Fix:** Made the node drain more robust -- [story #155549518](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/155549518), [story #156008895](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/156008895) and [cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release#181](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/issues/181).
* **Fix:** Included a kube-proxy dependency (conntrack) to fix error logs -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/154818002).
* **Fix:** Can use `kubectl top node` against a CFCR cluster. __Caveat:__ the `--heapster-scheme='https'` flag needs to be included -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/154906631).
* **GCP:** Stopped the Kube-Controller-Manager from creating unnecessary routes -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/155977766).
    - This was causing high Google Cloud API usage.
* **AWS:** Added the ability to provide AWS credentials in the BOSH manifest -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/155507606).
    - Previously, AWS access could only be granted by setting the IAM profile in the cloud config. In cases of BOSH Directors that are used by multiple deployments, it is necessary to provide the credentials in the BOSH manifest.

## v0.12.0

**Release Date:** January 10, 2018

[Download](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/releases/download/v0.12.0/kubo-deployment-0.12.0.tgz) the release artifact.

* Use Kubernetes 1.8.6 -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/154101118).
* Enable secure access to the Dashboard via a `NodePort` when using RBAC -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/154051302).
* Privileged container support is turned off by default. There is a new property named `allow_privileged_containers` in `director.yml` which can be used to enable the feature -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153848167).
  - also [cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment#252](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/pull/252) and [cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release#153](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/pull/153)
* Don't update the master node when scaling up workers -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/154036901).
* Switch to use `cfcr.internal` as a TLD instead of `.kubo` -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153849646).
* Disable all profiling / tracing endpoints by default -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/154051304).
* Always validate `ServiceAccount` tokens exist in etcd as part of authentication -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153592391).
* Stop the Kubernetes API Server from serving unsecured and unauthenticated access in localhost -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153592275).
* Remove unnecessary flag from `kube-proxy` -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/150079004).
* Make applying addon specs not fail if the specs are empty -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/154030804) / [cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release#150](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/issues/150).
* Bump system specs timeout to work with slower environments -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/154051298).
* Implement logic to never lose more than one worker nodes during update -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/154051299).
* Restrict the data directory permissions for etcd -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153592400).
* Use SSL for etcd peer connections -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153782872).
  - We are currently running single-node etcd clusters so no peer connections are established. Nevertheless, etcd would listen for peer connections over plain HTTP.
* **Openstack:** `openstack_tenant` is not required in the `director.yml` as it is obsolete for OpenStack Keystone v3. The property still exists as it is needed by OpenStack Keystone v2 -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153137960).
* **Openstack:** VMs deleted from the IaaS in OpenStack do not appear as ghost nodes -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153816342).
  - The fix for this issue introduces new `director.yml` properties as the OpenStack K8s Cloud Provider needs to be configured:
     * `auth_url`, `openstack_username`, `openstack_password`, `openstack_project_id`, `openstack_domain`
  - **Caveat:** the BOSH director needs to have `human_readable_vm_names` set to `false` in order for the Kubelet to register with the API Server successfully. See K8s issue: [kubernetes/kubernetes#57765](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57765).
* **Fix:** `deploy_k8s` to fail when the addon specs are not successfully applied -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153401157).
* **Fix:** regression in `abac` authorization mode -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153875025).
* **vSphere** **PR** Support CFCR deployments on vSphere environments with multiple datacenters -- [cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release#127](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/issues/127) / [cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release#148](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/pull/148).

## BOSH Release

* Rename BOSH jobs to better reflect the Kubernetes processes names -- [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/151088854).
* **PR** Expose parameters for logging level change -- [cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release#151](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/pull/151).
* **PR** Expose Block Storage parameters for Openstack -- [cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release#152](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/pull/152).

[Download](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/releases/download/v0.11.0/kubo-deployment-0.11.0.tgz) the release artifact.

* Rename the CF Routing properties in `director.yml` to follow a consistent naming style. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153171539).
    - **[ACTION REQUIRED]**: If you use CF Routing in CFCR, you must update your `director.yml` with the new CF Routing property names.
* Implement ability to deploy CFCR on an existing BOSH Director and make the experience for BOSH-native users comparable to the one in cf-deployment, bosh-deployment, and concourse-deployment. [PR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/pull/237).
    - **[ACTION REQUIRED]**: If you deploy CFCR by means of `bosh deploy`, you should re-examine the names of the manifest and the ops-files as various changes have been made.
* **vSphere**: Support persistent workloads on vSphere environments that do not use Resource Pools. Resource Pools are optional in vSphere and CFCF already supports vSphere environments that make use of Resource Pools.  [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153646184).
* Looked into an issue with the `kubernetes-system-spec` post-start script.  [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153535114) / [Github Issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/issues/143).

### Theme: Security

* **AWS**: Reduce the permissions of the AWS IAM policies for the master and worker nodes so that if credentials leak from an AWS CFCR node, the permissions associated with it are minimal. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/151445255).
    - **[ACTION REQUIRED]**: If you deploy CFCR on AWS, you must re-run Terraform to update the IAM Policies.
* Use stemcell version 3468.13.  [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153557143).
* Disallow anonymous requests to the API server.  [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153561120).
* Alter the permissions of files with sensitive information so that they cannot be read by non-root users. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/152711831).
* Make ETCD only listen to TLS connections so that ETCD-bound traffic in the cluster cannot be sniffed. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153098701).
* Disallow `exec` and `attach` commands to privileged pods. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153592296).
* **vSphere**: Escape back-slashes for vSphere users in cloud config. [PR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/pull/121).

[Download](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/releases/download/v0.10.0/kubo-deployment-0.10.0.tgz) the release artifact.

* New property `addons_spec_path` in `director.yml`. Operators can use this property to provide a K8s spec file that is applied to the cluster when it comes up. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/152647926).
* New property `worker_count` in `director.yml`. Operators can use this property to configure the number of K8s workers. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153055729).
* Enabled the K8s aggregation layer to support API server extensions. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/152931645).
* CFCR was tested to run with 20 workers and "chatty" workloads. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153171519).
* Exposed the K8s API connection properties via a BOSH link. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153321194).
* **[ACTION REQUIRED]**: The HAProxy (`proxy`) routing mode is not longer supported. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/152231249).
* **[ACTION REQUIRED]** **GCP**: The `service_account` property in `director.yml` is no longer supported. It has been replaced by `service_account_master` and `service_account_worker` which can be used to reference GCP service accounts that are provided to master and worker VMs separately. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/150975060).
* **GCP**: New properties `service_key_master` and `service_key_worker` in `director.yml`. Operators can use these properties to enable the K8s cloud provider to use a GCP service account without having to change the BOSH cloud config. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153171508).
* **GCP:** The GCP K8s Service Catalog was tested on CFCR. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/153293570).
* **GCP:** Predefined a `standard` storage class to be applied when CFCR is deployed on GCP. It uses the `gce-pd` PV provisioner. [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2093412/stories/152853461).

### Upgrading from v0.7.0

Perform the following steps to upgrade an existing CFCR v0.7.0 cluster to v0.8.0:

1. Clone the new version of [kubo-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment).
2. Log in to the CredHub server on your BOSH Director with the [CredHub CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub-cli).
3. Delete the current Kubernetes certificate from CredHub:
	<p class="terminal">$ credhub delete -n "\${director_name}/\${deployment_name}/tls-kubernetes"</p>
3. Verify that the appropriate stemcell is installed in BOSH. To view the uploaded stemcells, run the following command.
	<p class="terminal">$ bosh stemcells</p>
	To upload a new stemcell, run `bosh upload stemcell STEMCELL_URL`.
4. See the [BOSH Bootloader repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader) for information on how to update the BOSH Director.
5. See [CFCR repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release) for information about upgrading your CFCR cluster.


1. Deploy the CFCR BOSH release. See the [CFCR repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release) for instructions.
